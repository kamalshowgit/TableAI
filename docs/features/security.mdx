## Privacy-First Design

TableAI is built with privacy and security as core principles. Your data never leaves your machine, ensuring complete control and confidentiality.

## Local Processing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Local AI Models"
    icon="microchip"
  >
    All AI processing uses locally-running Ollama models. No data sent to external APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Offline Capable"
    icon="wifi-slash"
  >
    Works completely offline once models are downloaded. No internet required for analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Your Hardware"
    icon="server"
  >
    Runs entirely on your own machine using your computing resources.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="No Telemetry"
    icon="eye-slash"

    No usage tracking, analytics, or data collection of any kind.
  </Card>

## Code Execution Security

TableAI implements multiple layers of security for AI-generated code execution:

### Sandboxed Environment

```python
# Example of security filtering
forbidden_patterns = [
    r'os\.',           # Operating system access
    r'subprocess',     # Process execution
    r'open\(',         # File operations
    r'exec\(',         # Code execution
    r'eval\(',         # Dynamic evaluation
    r'import sys',     # System module
    r'import socket',  # Network access
    r'requests',       # HTTP requests
    r'urllib'          # URL operations
]
```

### Safe Execution Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Code Sanitization">
    All AI-generated code is scanned and cleaned before execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Limited Scope">
    Code runs in isolated environment with restricted variable access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timeout Protection">
    Execution is limited by time to prevent infinite loops
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error Handling">
    Comprehensive error catching prevents crashes and data exposure
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Protection

### File Handling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Temporary Storage">
    - Files are stored in secure temporary directories
    - Automatic cleanup after processing
    - No permanent storage of user data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Memory Management">
    - Data loaded into memory only when needed
    - Automatic garbage collection
    - No data persistence between sessions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Access Control">
    - Read-only access to uploaded files
    - No modification of original data
    - Isolated processing environment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Database Connections

<Warning>
**Connection Security**: Database credentials are handled securely and not logged or stored permanently.
</Warning>

- Connections are established per-session only
- No credential caching or storage
- Support for encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
- Read-only access recommended

## Network Security

<Tip>
**Air-Gapped Operation**: TableAI can operate completely disconnected from the internet once initial setup is complete.
</Tip>

### No External Dependencies

- ✅ Local AI models (Ollama)
- ✅ Local web interface (Streamlit)
- ✅ Local data processing (pandas)
- ❌ No cloud API calls
- ❌ No external model services
- ❌ No data uploads

### Firewall Friendly

- Only uses local ports (default: 8501)
- No outbound connections required
- Compatible with strict network policies

## Compliance & Standards

### Data Residency

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Complete Data Residency"
    icon="home"
